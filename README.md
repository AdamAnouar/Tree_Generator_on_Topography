# Tree Generator on Topography
The aim of this repository is to provide customizable components for generating structured networks using 
pathfinders and search algorithms. and Simple examples of possibilities of combinations and integration to an iterative process.

## PathFinder through Topography
- A-Star and Dijkstra's algorithm components to find the shortest path through topography.
- A first version of these components that only works with grid-like quadmeshes.
- A second version that works with all kind of mesh topologies.

## Minimum Spanning Tree
Create a tree with the minimum number of segments to connect a group of points using the Prim's algorithm.
